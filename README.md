# shortest-path-algorithm

## 1. Introduction 
Aim of this project is to obtain the shortest distance that starts in Ankara, visits every other city and returns back to Ankara. Firstly, excel files were read in Python. In the second stage of this project, any way to go was considered to understanding better the shortest way. Attempts were made to generate algorithms for the shortest possible path. After, specific algorithms were used as the genetic algorithm. The shortest path problem is deﬁned as that of ﬁnding a minimum-length path between a given pair of nodes. All of these steps and Python code was described in detail in the following stages of the report.
