# shortest-path-algorithm

## Introduction 
Aim of this project is to obtain the shortest distance that starts in Ankara, visits every other city and returns back to Ankara. Firstly, excel files were read in Python. In the second stage of this project, any way to go was considered to understanding better the shortest way. Attempts were made to generate algorithms for the shortest possible path. After, specific algorithms were used as the genetic algorithm. The shortest path problem is deﬁned as that of ﬁnding a minimum-length path between a given pair of nodes. All of these steps and Python code was described in detail in the following stages of the report. 

### genetic algorithm
The genetic algorithm was used to find the shortest route that starts in Ankara, visits every other city and returns back to Ankara. The shortest distance was calculated and it was plotted. 
The process begins with a set of individuals which is called a population after the coordinates are determined as a function. An individual is characterized by a set of variables known as path. It was indicated in the following Python code. 

This project was presented a genetic algorithm for solving the shortest path routing problem. The results show that the shortest-path routing based on genetic algorithm was a fast algorithm. The performance of the genetic algorithm could be increased by altering the parameters. 
According to the results, the following figures were determined. In generation 162, best path are 18361 as shown in Figure 4 and Figure 5. If the generation is increased, the shortest path will be decreased with more desired results. Also, The results show that genetic algorithm gets close to optimum very quickly.
